# 16BCOMP
As part of my undergraduate courses, created a functional computer with a simple 16 bit architecture using 
virtual simulation  in a bottom-up manner using only NAND gates. Wrote an assembler, a VM language interpreter 
and a basic compiler for an LL-2 high-level language (which adhere to the given language specifications) in C++.
